| Hiking | I love to get outside, I work part time at The Alpine Shop, where I assist people in picking gear for their next outdoor journey |
| Skiing  | My absolute favorite passtime, I want to live in the mountains when I graduate, I strive to be able to ski every day until I cannot walk anymore. |
| Video Games | This is how I have filled the last two years of my college experience since covid ended my college social life. |
